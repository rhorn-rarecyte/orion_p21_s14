The normal mucosal surface of the tongue is at the bottom of the image and the nodule of invasive cancer is seen in the top half, surrounded by fibrous reaction. The slide was stained with StrataPlex\u2122 Reagents and imaged using the Orion Instrument. All markers were stained in a single staining procedure and imaged in a single scan. \n\nNote that at the lower left edge of the section is a brightly stained region. This is fluorescence of a marking pigment used to delineate the border of the tumor resection specimen. \n", "Rotation": 0, "Layout": {"Grid": [["i0"]]}, "Stories": [{"Name": "", "Description": "", "Waypoints": [{"Name": "Normal tongue mucosa", "Description": "The mucosa of the tongue contains a stratified squamous epithelium with extensions (rete pegs) that project into the underlying connective tissue (lamina propria).
